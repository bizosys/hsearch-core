/**
 * {@inheritDoc}
 * <p/>
 * This extension of the {@link HTable} class provides a mechanism to initiate
 * and run scanners for each region in parallel. This is achieved using the a
 * {@link ExecutorService} and a {@link ServerCallable} for each region. Each
 * callable in responsible for fetching 'hbase.client.scanner.caching'* rows
 * from its region per invocation.
 * <p/>
 * In order to limit the number of rows pulled into memory on the client the
 * region callable is not resubmitted to the {@link ExecutorService} until it's
 * previous set of results has been consumed. As a result the order of the rows
 * will not necessarily be in key order. This has several side effects;
 * <ul>
 * <li>The provided {@link Scan} cannot specify a
 * {@link Scan#setStartRow(byte[]) start row} or a
 * {@link Scan#setStopRow(byte[]) stop row}.
 * <li>The provided {@link Scan#getFilter()} cannot abort the result set
 * processing using the {@link Filter#filterAllRemaining()} method.
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 ** If the 'hbase.client.scanner.caching' results in 1 then the value is over
 * written with {@link #DEFAULT_SCANNER_CACHING} value.
